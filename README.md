# -Yo-tgBot-PetProject-
Yo\Bro bot
this is my first pet project
In addition to the Go language, I used such frameworks as: telego, pgx v4, pgx pool
This project implements the "Bro" application from the "Silicon Valley" series, only in telegram, with a link to the postgres database
P.S. This is not the final version of the project, there is still a lot of work to be done on it
